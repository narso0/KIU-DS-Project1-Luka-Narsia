# KIU-DS-Project1-Luka-Narsia
First project for Data Science class
Project Description:
This project demonstrates key Python and NumPy fundamentals through three progressive tasks that build up from basic programming concepts to applied data analysis.
The goal is to simulate a realistic end-to-end data science workflow — from basic Python operations to generating, cleaning, and analyzing synthetic health and fitness data.


Task Breakdown:
Task 1 – Python Basics & Logic
Introduces core Python programming skills, including:
Variables, lists, loops, and conditional statements
Basic data manipulation and summarization
Simple function design and logical operations
This task establishes the foundational coding logic used in later analysis.


Task 2 – NumPy Arrays & Operations
Focuses on the use of NumPy for efficient numerical computing:
Array creation, reshaping, and slicing
Element-wise operations and broadcasting
Aggregations (mean, sum, min, max) and indexing
Vectorized computations replacing manual loops
This task builds computational efficiency and prepares for large-scale data handling.


Task 3 – Applied Data Analysis
Applies all previous concepts to perform a comprehensive, NumPy-only analysis on simulated fitness tracker data:
Data Generation: 100 users × 90 days × 4 metrics (steps, calories, active minutes, heart rate)
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values (NaNs) and removes outliers using IQR and mean imputation
Analysis:
User behavior and activity level classification
Temporal trends (7-day rolling averages, weekly and monthly insights)
Correlation matrix between metrics
Goal achievement evaluation (>80% of days met)
Reporting: Highlights top active users, most consistent performers, and key correlations.
